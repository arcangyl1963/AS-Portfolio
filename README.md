My files can be accessed in the repository [HERE](https://github.com/arcangyl1963/AS-Portfolio)<br>

![Porfolio Repository](./assets/images/readme_portfolio_repository.png)<br>

The web application can be viewed [HERE](https://arcangyl1963.github.io/AS-Portfolio/).<br>

The images below show the updated portfolio page design and highlights to some of the new features that have been added:<br>

The main page shows the redesigned layout featuring an updated theme and background image. The work project sections are displayed by default while the About bio section is hidden.<br>
